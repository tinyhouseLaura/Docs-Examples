Canva is a graphic design tool that allows users to create graphics for social media posts, business cards, videos, and more. This program is an accessible tool for people new to design as seasoned vets due to its wide variety of templates and a free-to-use option. This guide is for users, like designers or content creators, who want to learn about Canva has to offer and how it can help them create graphic content.

## First context section <!-- Header optional if there's only one section in the article -->

The first section should be about the main idea of the topic. The title for an explanation section generally starts with a noun. For example, "History of computers".

For example, if you were writing about computers, you could go into more detail about what they do, how they work, and so on. This would expand on the information that was in the introduction paragraph. 

{:.note}
> **Note**: You can also use notes to highlight important information. Try to keep them short. 

### Subsection with more details <!-- Optional --> 

Subsections go into more detail about some aspect of the functionality, concept, or bigger picture context of the topic. Subsection titles should also start with a noun. For example, "Computers and the internet".

For example, if you were writing about the larger context of computers in the main section, you could write about the history of computers in this section or the history of a particular computer.
 
Keep in mind that H2 is the highest header level a topic can have. If you are using nested headers, make sure that they're sequential. An H2 can contain an H3, but not the other way around.
 
## Second context section <!-- Optional -->

Additional sections contain more information about another element of your topic. You could write about the benefits and drawbacks of your topic or you could write about how your topic interacts with another part of the software in depth.

For example, if you were writing about computers, this section could cover the benefits of using a computer, with the title "Computer benefits".

"Using a computer has the following benefits:

* Complete tasks in a faster amount of time than if you were completing them manually
* Surf the internet"

## See also <!-- Optional -->

This section should include a list of tutorials or how-to guides that a user can visit to extend their learning from this explanation article.
